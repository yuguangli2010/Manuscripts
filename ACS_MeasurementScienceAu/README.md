1. These are supporting files for our ACS Measurement Science Au manuscript (DOI: XXX) 

2. "Temp_CV" VI is for running cyclic voltammetry and "Temp_EIS" VI is for running electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. 

3. "DAQ Assistant" subVI is required, so you would need to download the NI-DAQ module from National Instrument. It is also likely that the configurations of the DAQ Assistant need to be updated to reflect your wiring configuration. 

4. Several subVIs come from "Autolab SDK" package, which is downloaded from the Metrhom.
